# China Dyslipidemia and Lipid Metabolism Drug Pipeline and Near‑Market Landscape as of February 11, 2026

## Executive summary

China’s dyslipidemia drug landscape has shifted rapidly from a “statin/ezetimibe + imported PCSK9” paradigm toward a multi‑mechanism market that now includes **multiple domestically developed PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies** already approved and launched/launching, plus **RNA‑based drugs** and **novel lipid‑pathway targets** entering pivotal studies.

Publicly visible late‑stage “next wave” programs for China include:
- **ANGPTL3 silencing (RNAi)**: VSA003 (Visirna) is in a **China‑based Phase III** in adolescent/adult HoFH patients and has received **Breakthrough Therapy** recognition in China (per hospital and industry reporting) with Phase III trial registration visible on China’s clinical-trial disclosure platforms.
- **ANGPTL3 antibody**: Hengrui’s SHR‑1918 has published China Phase II data in HoFH and has ongoing clinical development for broader dyslipidemia.
- **ACLY inhibition (oral, statin‑intolerance niche)**: bempedoic acid tablets (贝派度酸片) are in a **China Phase III** program (CTR20244318; also mirrored as NCT06780410).
- **SPPARMα (TG‑focused) innovation**: pemafibrate has China Phase III evidence and publications showing benefits on TG with potentially favorable hepatic/renal safety vs fenofibrate in Chinese patients.
- **Lp(a)‑targeted therapies**: pelacarsen’s global Phase III Lp(a)HORIZON trial includes extensive China sites; topline readout timing was publicly discussed as a key 2026 cardiovascular catalyst.

On the “already approved” side, China now has **four domestic PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies approved** (tafolecimab, ebronucimab, ongericimab, recaticimab) alongside imported **evolocumab** and **alirocumab**, as well as **inclisiran** (siRNA) with a China monotherapy approval update in January 2026 and NRDL access expectations highlighted in investor materials.

From a market‑opportunity perspective, dyslipidemia remains highly prevalent in China (national survey prevalence reported around **35.6%** among adults ≥18 in 2018) and treatment/control in broad populations has been persistently suboptimal, which expands the “headroom” for add‑ons (PCSK9 mAbs/siRNA, ACLY inhibitors, Lp(a) and TG‑targeted therapies) as reimbursement and guideline uptake improve.

## Scope, data sources, and caveats

This report covers **China‑relevant drugs** for **dyslipidemia and lipid metabolism disorders** (including primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, familial hypercholesterolemia—including HoFH—and elevated Lp(a)), focusing on:
- drugs **approved in China**;
- drugs **in China clinical development** (Phase I–III) or with **China NDA/BLA filings/acceptances** publicly disclosed; and
- select global pivotal programs with **documented China site participation** (notably Lp(a)HORIZON).

Priority sources were:
- National Medical Products Administration announcements (Chinese/English pages where accessible) for approvals and indications;
- ClinicalTrials.gov NCT records and attached protocols when accessible;
- China drug trial disclosure listings (e.g., “CTR…” entries mirrored by third‑party viewers that cite the official platform);
- company press releases and investor presentations;
- peer‑reviewed publications (Phase II/III outcomes, Chinese substudies, safety).

Caveat on completeness: “**preclinical**” China programs are not systematically discoverable via public registries; therefore, **preclinical coverage is best‑effort and likely incomplete**, while **IND/clinical and approved** coverage is intended to be comprehensive for programs identifiable through the above primary sources as of 2026‑02‑11.

## Safety, competitive positioning, and China market opportunity

### Clinical context and unmet need in China

China’s adult dyslipidemia prevalence remains high: the 2018 national survey prevalence among adults ≥18 years is reported as **35.6%**, and multiple national and provincial analyses emphasize that dyslipidemia is often inadequately treated and LDL‑C targets are frequently unmet, even among established ASCVD patients.

For established ASCVD, a large China dataset reported low lipid‑lowering treatment penetration and modest LDL‑C control, including an LDL‑C (≤70 mg/dL) control rate around **26.6%** among adults with ASCVD, with substantial gaps between treated and untreated individuals.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) remains underdiagnosed: one China review estimated ~**5.5 million** FH patients with <1% diagnosis/treatment in China.

This creates a tiered opportunity:
- **Broad mass market**: statins + ezetimibe/absorption inhibitors (including hybutimibe) and TG drugs.
- **High‑risk intensification**: PCSK9 mAbs + inclisiran + (future) bempedoic acid.
- **Precision lipid disorders**: HoFH and severe disorders requiring LDLR‑independent or ANGPTL3‑directed mechanisms.

### Competitive positioning by therapeutic “job to be done”

**First-line LDL‑C lowering (statins, often with ezetimibe)** is the default comparator set; novel drugs enter when:
- LDL‑C remains above target despite maximally tolerated statins (common in very‑high‑risk ASCVD);
- statin intolerance limits high‑intensity dosing; or
- monogenic disorders (FH/HoFH) require more potent or LDLR‑independent pathways.

**China’s PCSK9 antibody “stack” (evolocumab/alirocumab + multiple domestic mAbs)** creates intra‑class competition. Published Phase III results for tafolecimab, ongericimab, and ebronucimab show LDL‑C lowering in the ~50–60%+ range versus placebo under various regimens, consistent with PCSK9 antibody class benchmarks.

**Inclisiran** may differentiate primarily on **dosing frequency and adherence economics**, with investor materials explicitly framing 2026 as a commercial “opening.”

**Bempedoic acid** (if approved) is strategically positioned for **statin‑intolerant** or statin‑limited patients needing an additional oral LDL‑C option, but will compete against (and be complemented by) the PCSK9 class depending on price and access.

**Icosapent ethyl** competes in “residual risk” and hypertriglyceridemia segments, differentiated by outcomes-based indications and successive China approvals (VHTG then CVRR).

**ANGPTL3‑directed programs** (VSA003, SHR‑1918) are notable because they target lipid metabolism beyond LDL‑C alone and may offer LDLR‑independent benefit relevant to HoFH.

### Safety signals likely to shape China adoption

Across key mechanisms:
- **PCSK9 mAbs**: injection‑site reactions and mild infections are common; pivotal China trials report generally good tolerability and placebo‑like TEAE rates in some materials.
- **Inclisiran**: injection‑site reactions are expected; longer‑interval dosing may reduce treatment burden, potentially aiding adherence.
- **Bempedoic acid**: gout/hyperuricemia and gallstone signals are prominent in global evidence syntheses and should be monitored in China Phase III.
- **Lomitapide**: while China approval reporting focuses on unmet need and rapid review, clinicians should expect hepatic and GI monitoring requirements consistent with the MTP mechanism (China label specifics not retrieved here).
- **ANGPTL3 therapies**: safety is still being defined for VSA003 (ongoing Phase III) and SHR‑1918 (Phase II).

### Estimated China market opportunity

Because pricing and reimbursement are dynamic, this section provides **scenario-based sizing** grounded in epidemiology and program positioning.

**Addressable prevalence (baseline)**
- Adult dyslipidemia prevalence in China was reported as **35.6%** in a national survey (2018).
- Dyslipidemia management remains suboptimal in population studies, with important gaps in treatment and control.
- FH burden estimates in China include multi‑million scale, with very low diagnosis/treatment rates.
- HoFH is rare but high‑impact; multiple China sources cite **~5,000** patients, aligning with the urgency behind HoFH pathways (lomitapide approval; VSA003 Phase III).

**Commercial segmentation (illustrative)**
- **Mass dyslipidemia** (statins, ezetimibe/hybutimibe): largest by volume; pricing pressure and generic dominance; innovation uptake depends on incremental benefit vs cost.
- **High/very‑high ASCVD risk needing intensive LDL‑C lowering**: meaningful opportunity for PCSK9 mAbs and inclisiran; the JAMA dataset showing low treatment rates among ASCVD patients implies significant “room to grow” as access expands.
- **Statin intolerance / statin‑limited patients**: bempedoic acid could expand oral non‑statin options if China Phase III succeeds.
- **Residual TG risk / CV risk reduction**: VASCEPA’s CVRR approval creates a branded therapy niche beyond TG lowering.
- **Rare genetic lipid disorders**: HoFH remains a small‑population but high‑value segment (lomitapide; potential future ANGPTL3 therapies).
- **Emerging Lp(a) market**: pelacarsen’s Phase III readout cycle (with many China sites) could catalyze a new prevention market if outcomes are positive; China launch would require local regulatory filings and reimbursement strategies.

**Pricing and reimbursement (what is publicly visible here)**
- Public sources in this run consistently emphasize **NRDL preparation** for VASCEPA and **NRDL “market opening for 2026”** framing for inclisiran, but do **not** provide authoritative negotiated net prices.
- Therefore, pricing is marked **unspecified** for most products; market opportunity is most sensitive to (1) NRDL entry, (2) provincial procurement, and (3) guideline‑driven uptake in ASCVD prevention.

## Key data gaps and reference map

### High‑impact data gaps (drug‑level)

- **China patent status**: For most innovative biologics and RNA drugs listed here, the China patent family (CN filings, expiry, SPC/extension where applicable) was **not retrievable** within accessible sources and is marked **unspecified** across dossiers.
- **Exact China label language and reimbursement pricing**: NMPA approvals are identifiable, but full label PDFs and NRDL price outcomes were not consistently accessible; thus, several entries include **approval confirmation without full label granularity**.
- **SAL003 Phase III results**: trial existence is clear (NCT records), but results are **not** captured in accessible sources for this run.
- **Early‑stage RNA programs**: Phase I evidence is often only partially public; detailed endpoints, dose‑response curves, and China regulatory interactions remain limited to brief disclosures.
