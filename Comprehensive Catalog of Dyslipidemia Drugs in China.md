# Comprehensive Catalog of Dyslipidemia Drugs in China

## Executive summary

China’s dyslipidemia innovation landscape has shifted from a statin/ezetimibe-centered market to a crowded **PCSK9 pathway** market (monoclonal antibodies, a long-acting siRNA, and additional next‑generation entrants), with **new RNA therapies for triglyceride disorders** and early **gene-editing** programs now appearing in Chinese regulatory and clinical-trial records.

The most consequential “recent” milestones (relative to the user’s as‑of date window of Feb 2026) are:
- **Inclisiran (Leqvio/乐可为)** received a **new China indication** on **January 28, 2026** enabling **monotherapy** use (adjunct to diet) for adult non‑familial primary hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia—expanding beyond prior “add‑on to statins/other LLTs” positioning.
- **Plozasiran (Redemplo/普乐司兰钠注射液; trade name 瑞达普)**—an **apoC‑III siRNA**—was **approved by China’s regulator** on **January 7, 2026** via priority review for **familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS)** to reduce triglycerides on top of dietary control.
- China now has **multiple domestically-developed PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies** approved (e.g., **tafolecimab**, **ongericimab**, **ebronucimab**, **recaticimab**) and additional late-stage/imported contenders (e.g., **lerodalcibep**) aiming for 2026–2027 filings/approvals in Greater China.

From a market-sizing perspective, China’s adult dyslipidemia burden is very large, but treatment and control rates remain low by multiple sources, creating a wide funnel for intensified lipid-lowering therapy. For example, a 2018 national survey cited in the 2023 Chinese lipid guideline reported **35.6% prevalence** in adults ≥18 years.  A cardiovascular report summary (China CVD report 2021) reports dyslipidemia among adults ≥35 years at **16.1%**, with **treatment 7.8%** and **control 4.0%**, underscoring a persistent “implementation gap.”

## Methods and scope

This catalog prioritizes **up-to-date, China-relevant, pharmacologic and biotechnologic therapies** intended to treat dyslipidemia phenotypes (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, mixed dyslipidemia, FH, elevated Lp(a)), with emphasis on: (a) **approved innovative therapies in China**, and (b) **clinical-stage (Phase I–III) or near-filing candidates with explicit China regulatory or trial presence**. The anchor sources prioritized were: Chinese approvals/approval notices from the National Medical Products Administration, reimbursement/NRDL information from the National Healthcare Security Administration where available, trial identifiers from Chinese Clinical Trial Registry and ClinicalTrials.gov, plus peer‑reviewed publications and company announcements.

Important limitations:
- **Preclinical pipelines in China are not fully transparent**; therefore, “all drugs” at the *preclinical* stage cannot be guaranteed comprehensive without paid/closed databases and direct company disclosures. This report is intended to be **near-complete for approvals and late-stage/China-visible clinical programs** as of February 2026, but **incompleteness risk rises** as one moves earlier in R&D.
- Many trials are registered with minimal publicly disclosed results; where topline outcomes are not publicly available, fields are marked **Unspecified**.

## China clinical and commercial context

The policy and clinical context behind China’s rapid uptake of injectable LDL‑C therapies is the combination of (i) high prevalence of dyslipidemia and (ii) documented gaps in awareness/treatment/control. A systematic review/meta-analysis (mainland China adults) estimated dyslipidemia prevalence at **~42.1%**, with awareness/treatment/control at **18.2%/11.6%/5.4%**, respectively.  The 2023 Chinese lipid guideline cites national survey data that dyslipidemia prevalence in adults ≥18 was **35.6% (2018 survey)**, higher than the 2015 survey referenced therein.

High-intensity and “next-step” lipid therapies in China tend to cluster around these segments:
- **ASCVD/very high risk** patients not reaching LDL‑C targets on maximally tolerated oral therapy (statins ± ezetimibe), which aligns with the labeled positioning of the newly approved PCSK9 antibodies and inclisiran for combination therapy.
- **Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: prevalence estimates vary by method; e.g., China PEACE Million Persons Project analysis reported **FH prevalence 0.13% (≈1 in 769) in ages 35–75** using Chinese FH criteria.
- **Hypertriglyceridemia and rare TG syndromes** such as **FCS**, now directly addressed by approved apoC‑III siRNA therapy (plozasiran) in China.
- **Elevated Lp(a)** and residual risk: a mainland China adult meta-analysis estimated elevated Lp(a) prevalence at **~19.4%** (noting study heterogeneity and definitions).

## Pricing and reimbursement notes

Because China drug payment policy is dynamic and negotiated, this report treats “pricing” as **publicly disclosed** only when found in sources. Key points supported by accessible sources include:
- **Repatha (evolocumab)** and **Praluent (alirocumab)** were cited among **2021 NRDL additions** in an industry readout.
- A Chinese media report describes Praluent’s NRDL-related price reduction and notes subsequent patient-reported supply disruptions.
- Novartis states inclisiran’s earlier China indications were included in the **2025 NRDL** (effective Jan 1, 2026) while the **new monotherapy indication** (approved Jan 28, 2026) is not yet in NRDL coverage scope.

For most newer domestic PCSK9 mAbs (tafolecimab/ongericimab/ebronucimab/recaticimab) and for newly approved plozasiran, **publicly verifiable, primary-source pricing** was not consistently available through the accessible primary payer sources in this browsing session, and is therefore marked **Unspecified** unless otherwise stated.
